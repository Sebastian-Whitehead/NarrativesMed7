# NarrativesMed7

The repoistory contains the hand in material for the Narratives in Interactive systems for the 2023 Medialogy 7th semester. The project contains a unity implementation of a virtual museum combining AI generated narration with a HDRP 3d environment to create an immersive edutainment platform that could potentially be used on any number of applicable narratives. The current prototype focuses on the historic battle of Kursk from WWII exploring both sides of the conflict in a controllable narrative platform. 

## Requirements
The current unity implementation uses the High definition render pipeline together with a number of high polygon count  3d models and over 60 individual light sources. For optimal use it is suggested that a mid to high end computer with a dedicated graphics processor is used to experience the virtual museum. 

Use of headphones is also recommended for the optimal virtual museum experience.

## Installation 
 1. Download or clone the unity environment
 2. Open the unity environment and open the outdoor scene
 3. Run the environment as is and enjoy
 
 If your computer does not meet the minimum requirements for environment a video file of a playthrough has been packaged with the hand in through digital exam
